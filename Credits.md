### Comparison to Other Mods

> This mod is not intended to steal the work of others, nor replace them as simple copycats or
> version ports. **Significant transformative changes** are made to the referenced mods, often
> sacrificing features as well as configurability. Additional features are implemented to tailor
> them to our mod's vision. In these ways, we view our mod as sufficiently transformative and more
> than a simple "copycat" of other mods. Out of good faith, the mod authors are also credited below,
> no matter how little their mod was referenced.
