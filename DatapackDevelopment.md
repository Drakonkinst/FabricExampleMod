# Data Pack Development

Data packs can be used to add content to or help integrate Worldsinger features without the use of
code.

## Item Tags

We do not recommend overriding the list as this removes the default entries, but new entries can
help apply behavior to other items.

* `#worldsinger:kills_spore_growths`: Items that kill spore growth blocks when interacting or
  hitting
  a
  spore-killable block.

### Metals

* `#worldsinger:has_iron`: Items that contain iron. They will attract spore growths when worn or
  held.
* `#worldsinger:has_steel`: Items that contain steel. They will repel spore growths when worn or
  held.
* `#worldsinger:has_metal`: Items that contain ANY kind of metal, including Aluminum and other
  metals that Allomancy cannot interact with. Includes all of the above tags, but can be augmented
  with metals that do not fall in these categories.
